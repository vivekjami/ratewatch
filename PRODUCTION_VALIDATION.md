## 🛡️ Security Audit Results

### Dependency Security
- **All vulnerabilities fixed** - Updated dependencies to secure versions
- `slab` updated from 0.4.10 to 0.4.11 (RUSTSEC-2025-0047)
- `prometheus` updated from 0.13 to 0.14 (fixes protobuf vulnerability)
- `cargo audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities

### Authentication Security
- ✅ API key authentication with Blake3 hashing
- ✅ Minimum 32-character API key requirement
- ✅ Secure error handling without information leakage
- ✅ Rate limiting on API endpoints themselves

### Infrastructure Security
- ✅ Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Docker security (non-root user, read-only filesystem, no-new-privileges)
- ✅ Resource limits and health checks

## 🔒 GDPR Compliance Validation

### Right of Access (Article 15)
- ✅ `/v1/privacy/summary` endpoint implemented
- ✅ Returns user data summary without exposing PII
- ✅ Proper authentication required

### Right to Erasure (Article 17)
- ✅ `/v1/privacy/delete` endpoint implemented
- ✅ Complete data deletion for specified user
- ✅ Audit logging of deletion requests

### Data Minimization (Article 5)
- ✅ Only rate limit counters stored, no personal data
- ✅ User identifiers hashed in Redis keys
- ✅ No PII in logs or API responses

### Automatic Data Expiration
- ✅ Redis TTL set on all rate limit windows
- ✅ Automatic cleanup after window expiration
- ✅ No manual intervention required for compliance

## 🚀 Deployment Validation

- ✅ Health checks respond immediately
- ✅ Concurrent request handling stable

### Resource Usage
- ✅ Memory usage stable under load
- ✅ CPU usage optimized
- ✅ Redis connection pooling efficient

### Scalability
- ✅ Stateless design allows horizontal scaling
- ✅ Redis-based distributed rate limiting
- ✅ No single points of failure
